# FaceRecognition

## Data Scraping
In the the `datascraping.py` file we will be accessing the camera using the cv2 package of python, to take images of ourselves so that the program understands your face.

## Training the model
In the `trainmodel.py` file we will be training a neural network so that it recognizes your face.

## The finished product
In the `finalres.py` file we will acess the camera of your computer again. This time we will take the face found in the camera feed and give it to our model and let it decide whether it is you or somebody else.
